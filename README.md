# LINEX2 for METASPACE data

Create and analyze lipid networks to work with METASPACE/SpaceM data.

The primary application for now is the ranking of lipid annotations.

Check the `ranking_lipids` notebook for details and intructions.

Everything is built on the [LINEX2 method](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbac572).
