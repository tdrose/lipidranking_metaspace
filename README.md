# LINEX2 for METASPACE data

Create and analyze lipid networks to work with [METASPACE](https://metaspace2020.eu/) spatial lipidomics data or spatial single-cell lipidomics data ([SpaceM](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01198-0)).

This package is a work in progress, a publication and extended documentation will be available soon.
Until then, if you use this package, please cite the following preprint: [Rose et al. "METASPACE: A community-populated knowledge base for spatial metabolomics"](https://doi.org/10.1101/539478 )

The package was built, by extending the [LINEX2 method](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbac572) for creating dataset-specific lipid metabolic networks from lipidomics data.
